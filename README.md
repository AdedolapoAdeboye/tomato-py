Hey Welcome, This is a repository name Toamto as you can see in the repository name obviously...
there are two important files in the repo you need to focus on namely;
app.py & app-gui.py

They are basically the same but the main difference is that one is GUI based while the other is Terminal based.

There are still rooms for many improvement because it will still be ported to a Windows Executable file(.exe), Debian package(.deb), Macintosh Image file (.deg) and Adroid Application package (.apk).

If you want to collaborate, simply mail me at my email address ==> abrahamadeboye00@gmail.com


I hope this program helps you alot.


NB: This is a free software and you're free to share but always include credit. Thanks
