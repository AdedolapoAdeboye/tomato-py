# Tomato-py
Hey Welcome, This is a Scientific Calculator named Tomato as you can see in the repository...
There are 3 important files in the repo you need to focus on namely;

app.py ==>The basic file for basic code. It runs in the terminal.
app-gui.py  ==> The basic file plus advanced Features like GUI usint Tkinter. It can be use on Mac/Windows/Linux Environment
android.py  ==> This is a still the same file but it's been modified to Kivy-based so as to be ported to android executable file.


There are still rooms for many improvement because it will still be ported to a Windows Executable file(.exe), Debian package(.deb), Macintosh Image file (.deg) and Adroid Application package (.apk).

If you want to collaborate, simply mail me at my email address ==> (abrahamadeboye00@gmail.com)
